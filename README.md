# GDSC-Movie_Recommender
This task involves building a movie recommendation system using content-based and collaborative filtering techniques. Streamlit provides an interactive UI, while ngrok enables remote access in Google Colab. The system preprocesses data, trains models (e.g., SVD, KNN), and generates personalized recommendations, addressing challenges like ngrok authentication and session limits for seamless deployment.
It's taking a long time for loading the page, I tried to fix the error but couldn't so that's why I am uploading it late.
